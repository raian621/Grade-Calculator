## Grade Calculator
This program will be able to calculate your grade in a class given the percent weight of each type of
assignment (i.e. "Tests", "Homework", "Quizzes") and the grades that you have made on each assignment.

The purpose of this project is to practice using Git and Github, and to improve my proficiency with the
Java Swing GUI library.
